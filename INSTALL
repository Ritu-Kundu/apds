Pre-installation Instructions
=============================

   This installation requires the pre-installation of the cmake tool,
   a C++11 ready compiler such as g++ version 4.7, and the libraries: 
   libdivsufsort and sdsl.

For Linux, you can install libraries libdivsufsort and sdsl via

 $ ./pre-install.sh 


Basic Instructions
==================

   The shell command `make -f Makefile.32-bit.gcc' should compile this 
program for 32-bit integers. 
   
   The shell command `make -f Makefile.64-bit.gcc' should compile this 
program for 64-bit integers. This requires double the amount of memory.

After compilation the binary `apds' will be created in the working 
directory, e.g. you may call it from this directory via

 S ./apds  -a PROT -p ./data/pattern.txt -i ./data/sample.txt -o ./result/realOutput.txt
